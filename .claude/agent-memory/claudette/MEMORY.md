# Project Memory

## Wiki Structure
- Wiki pages are in `/Users/umudrakov/Documents/bootstrap/wiki/`
- Pages use GitHub Wiki link format: `[[Page-Name]]`
- Content is mostly in Russian
- Style reference: Polybar-Architecture.md is the gold standard for component documentation
- Navigation breadcrumbs at bottom: "Nazad k [[Home]] | Sm. takzhe: [[...]]"

## Ewwii Status Bar
- Ewwii is the CURRENT status bar (replaced Polybar)
- Documentation: Ewwii-Architecture.md (created 2026-02-08, consolidated from migration plan + troubleshooting)
- Ewwii-Migration.md was DELETED (migration is complete)
- Key references: Ewwii-Reference.md, Rhai-Reference.md, GTK-CSS-Reference.md
- CSS file MUST be named `ewwii.scss`, NOT `eww.scss`

## File Editing Patterns
- Always read files before editing
- Use Edit tool for targeted replacements
- Verify changes with Read after editing
- Check for stale references with Grep after renaming/deleting pages
