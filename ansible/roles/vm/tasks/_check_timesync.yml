# =========================================================================
# Common task file: Check for systemd-timesyncd conflicts
#
# This file checks if systemd-timesyncd is running and warns about
# potential conflicts with hypervisor time synchronization services.
#
# Many hypervisors (VMware, VirtualBox, Hyper-V) provide their own time
# synchronization mechanisms that can conflict with systemd-timesyncd.
#
# Usage:
#   - ansible.builtin.include_tasks: _check_timesync.yml
#     vars:
#       _vm_timesync_label: "VMware"
#       _vm_timesync_service: "vmtoolsd"
#
# Required parameters:
#   _vm_timesync_label (string)   - Hypervisor name for task names
#   _vm_timesync_service (string) - Name of the hypervisor service that manages time sync
#
# Behavior:
#   - Queries systemd to check if systemd-timesyncd is active
#   - If active: displays a warning with recommendation to disable it
#   - If inactive or not found: no action taken
#   - Never fails, only warns
#
# Exit conditions:
#   - Always succeeds (warning only, no failures)

      Consider disabling systemd-timesyncd to avoid conflicts:
      systemctl disable --now systemd-timesyncd
  when:
    - _vm_timesync_status.status is defined
    - _vm_timesync_status.status.ActiveState == 'active'
